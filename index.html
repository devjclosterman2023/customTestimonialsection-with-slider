        <p class="paraEl">There is a real dearth of information about how and why women in healthcare are so disproportionately affected by burnout. Maybe it’s partly because soft skills that women excel in aren’t valued even though our soft skills hold society together.</p>
      <p class="paraEl paraEl1">Dr. Laila Hishaw has a desire to create and cultivate safe spaces. She saw a glaring inequity and need and created Diversity In Dentistry Mentorships. She also addresses women in healthcare professions and their specific needs.</p>

        <p class="paraEl paraEl3">Sometimes you sit in a course expecting nothing, and once in a great moon, you get a life-changing, kick-in-the-pants lecture that wakes you up, and gives you a path for more purpose in life, something we all strive for. After listening to Dr. Laila Hishaw’s presentation, Leading with Inclusive Leadership, I pivoted. Thankfully. I am now mentoring two students, one in dental school, the other applying, both minorities, along with other community service events. Dr. Hishaw opened my eyes, gave me tools and the right push to enjoy more than just dentistry, but a purpose to help those that need us in this profession.</p>
